# Bank Marketing Campaign Analysis Using Deep Learning 

## Project Description
This project is based on the marketing campaign conducted by a bank to promote their product. Recently, there has been a decline in revenue for the bank and investigation has been carried out to identify the root of the problem. The bank found out that the reduce in revenue is mainly due to decrement of the deposition of money into the bank by the clients. Hence, the bank decided to conduct marketing campaigns to persuade more clients to subscribe to their product to increase revenue. Many aspects are taken into consideration such as promotional strategy, demographic, financial history, age and many more.

The objective of this project is to predict customer subcription of the marketed product in order to determine effectiveness of the campaign. Data collected contains details that could determine the possibily of the customer to subscribe to their product as well as to improve marketing strategy.

## Running the Project
This model run using Python programming and the libraries available.

## Project Insight
To achieve the objective of this project, deep learning approach using TensorFlow consedering the amount of dataset available. The deep learning model consist of Input, Dense, Dropout, and Batch Normalization layers with 128 epochs and patience of 10. Training loss and accuracy are also displayed using TensorBoard. The targeted accuracy for this model is 70% and more.

## Accuracy
After cleaning, selecting the best features and training the data, this model can achive up to 70% accuracy. 
Below are some of the result given by the model after training. However, result might slightly different when run multiple times.
